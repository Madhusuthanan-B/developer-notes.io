## Builder Design Pattern
* Some objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
* Having an object with 10 initializer arguments is not productive
* Instead, opt for piecewise construction
* Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

## Definition
 **When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly**

### Example

Lets take a look at the below code.

```js
class Address {
    constructor(zip, street) {
        this.zip = zip;
        this.street = street;
    }
}

class User {
    constructor(name, age, phone, address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.phone = phone;
        this.address = address;
    }
}

const user = new User('Bob', undefined, undefined, new Address('12345', 'street'));

console.log(user);
```

* We can see that the User class is taking many arguments.
* Due to this, if we want to create an user with only name and address, we need to mandatorily pass undefined as parameters.
