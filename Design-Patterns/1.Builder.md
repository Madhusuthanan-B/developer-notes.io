## Builder Design Pattern
* Some objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
* Having an object with 10 initializer arguments is not productive
* Instead, opt for piecewise construction
* Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

## Definition
 **When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly**
