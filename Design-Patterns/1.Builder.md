## Builder Design Pattern
* Some objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
* Having an object with 10 initializer arguments is not productive
* Instead, opt for piecewise construction
* Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

## Definition
 **When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly**

### Example

Lets take a look at the below code.

```js
class Address {
    constructor(zip, street) {
        this.zip = zip;
        this.street = street;
    }
}

class User {
    constructor(name, age, phone, address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.phone = phone;
        this.address = address;
    }
}

const user = new User('Bob', undefined, undefined, new Address('12345', 'street'));

console.log(user);
```

* We can see that the User class is taking many arguments.
* Due to this, if we want to create an user with only name and address, we need to mandatorily pass undefined as parameters.

### Traditional Builder

```js
class Address {
    constructor(zip, street) {
        this.zip = zip;
        this.street = street;
    }
}

class User {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class UserBuilder {
    constructor(name) {
        this.user = new User(name);
    }

    setAge(age) {
        this.user.age = age;
        return this;
    }

    setPhone(phone) {
        this.user.phone = phone;
        return this;
    }

    setAddress(address) {
        this.user.address = address;
        return this;
    }

    build() {
        return this.user;
    }
}

const user = new UserBuilder('Bob')
            .setAddress(new Address('12345', 'street'))
            .build();

console.log(user);
```
* Here, we have introduced a UserBuilder class which takes care of creating users.
* The UserBuilder class just needs the user name for creating a user.
* It also exposes methods from user builder which enables us to set required properties of a user as needed.

### Summary
* Many times, we may need multiple builders for constructing an object
* A builder is a separate component for building an object
* Can either give builder an initializer or return it via a static funtion
* To make builder fluent, return self
