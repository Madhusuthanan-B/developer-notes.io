## Gamma Categorization

### Creational Patterns
* Deal with the creation (Construction) of objects
* Explicit (Constructor) vs Implicit (DI, Reflection etc)
* Wholesale (Single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)

###Structural Patterns
* Concerned with structure (eg: class members)
* Stess the importance of good API design

### Behavioral Patterns
* They are all different; No central theme. Each solve a particular problem.
