## What is a web component?

A web component is made up of 3 important parts

* **A custom HTML element** - To register our own tags
* **Shadow DOM specification** - Manage a separate DOM node tree for our html elements (including scoped styles)
* **Templates & slots** - Define our own HTML structure hidden behind our custom elements. This lets to add some entry points where we can populate information from outside.
