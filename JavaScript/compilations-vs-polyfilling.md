### Compilation vs Polyfilling

#### Compiler

As we know that JavaScript as a language keeps evolving. We should always try to write code in latest JavaScript.
But wait a minute! This has a problem. 

**Does all browsers support all the specifications in latest JavaScript?**

Well, the answer is **NO**

This is exactly where Compilation come handy, which is done with the help of a Compiler.

> So basically, the compiler let us write latest JavaScript code and it takes care of converting this code into old JavaScript code which many browsers understand.

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is one of the most popular compiler out there
