# Closures

* According to our rule of scopes, all the variables within a function are deleted once the function finishes execution.
* How ever, when a function returns a function, then the function that is returned keeps a reference of any variables that it needs to execute.
* So closures are a special set of references to variables that a function needs. Basically variables which are outside the function's scope.
